#### **Motivation**
`provision` transfers specific quantities of sample from a resource to single or multiple wells. Currently, 
`provision` only allows sample quantity to be specified in volume. However, there often are cases
where sample needs to be specified in mass for both liquid and solid samples. To allow for
different transfer units, we are adding `measurement_mode` to specify unit type. We are also adding dict specific for
`mass` mode in the `to` parameter. For backward compatibility, we are keeping the `to` parameter the same
 for `volume` mode.

#### **Proposal**
We propose a more versatile `provision` instruction to support `mass` mode to allow provisioning by
mass unit in addition to `volume`.

```
{
  "op": "provision"
  /* Mode of Provision. Optional with default value to 'volume' */
  "measurement_mode": Enum("mass", "volume")
  /* 
   * Destination wells. To keep `provision` backward compatible, this can
   * be a list of either `volume`-specific dict or `mass` dict. Adding `mass` dict
   * as shown below.
   */
  "to":[
    /* parameters for 'mass'. Optional */
    {
      "well": Well
      "mass": Mass
    }
    ...
  ]
  ...
}

```
#### **Execution**
Devices present in the execution environment are capable of respecting specific volume or mass, and that optional
parameters default to sensible values when unspecified.

#### **Compatibility**
This change is backwards compatible; there are enough unit tests to ensure the changes will not break any existing
operations and features.

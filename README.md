2. Published - Accepted ASCs will be move to Published once they've been sent out to the mailing list for notification and no extraordinary comments are made. At this stage, they will be assigned a number and published at Autoprotocol.org

3. Redacted - Published ASCs could be redacted under rare circumstances. If so, they will be moved to this folder.

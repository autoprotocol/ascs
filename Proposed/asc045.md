#### **Motivation**
Evaporation is used to remove or isolate liquid solvent(s) and/or moisture from a mixture of compounds in a container under specified conditions. This process is often employed in chemical synthesis to precipitate or concentrate target compounds from a sample.

#### **Proposal**
We propose adding an `evaporate` instruction, with evaporation `mode`s parameterized by their `mode_params`. Samples can be `rotate`d in a flask, `centrifuge`d, and `vortexed`, or can have an inert gas blown across their surface via the `blowdown` mode.

```
{
  “op”: “evaporate”,
  “object”: Container,
  /* Duration to incubate the sample in the evaporator */
  “duration”: Time
  /*
   * Temperature at which the container is incubated. If specified, the device
   * in question will be brought up to temperature prior to the start of
   * the instruction
   */
  “evaporator_temperature”: Temperature
  /* Method applied to agitate the sample container */
  “mode”: Enum(“rotate”, “centrifuge”, “vortex”, “blowdown”),
  /* Parameters for the `rotate` mode */
  “mode_params”: {
    /*
     * Volume of the rotating flask that functions as the evaporation chamber.
     * Typically, the volume of the flask is at least double that of its
     * contents, such that there is ample surface area to facilitate
     * speedy evaporation
     */
    “flask_volume”: Volume,
    /* Speed at which flask is rotated */
    “speed”: Frequency
    /* Pressure applied to sample flask. Must be lower than ambient pressure */
    “vacuum_pressure”: Pressure
    /*
     * Temperature of the condenser chamber, where the evaporated material
     * is collected and returned to liquid phase
     */
    “condenser_temperature”: Temperature
  }
  /* Parameters for the `centrifuge` mode */
  “mode_params”: {
    /* Speed at which container is centrifuged */
    “spin_acceleration”: Acceleration
    /* Pressure applied to sample flask. Must be lower than ambient pressure */
    “vacuum_pressure”: Pressure
    /*
     * Temperature of the condenser chamber, where the evaporated material
     * is collected and returned to liquid phase
     */
    “condenser_temperature”: Temperature
  }
  /* Parameters for the `vortex` mode */
  “mode_params”: {
    /* Speed at which the sample container is vortexed */
    “vortex_speed”: Frequency
    /* Pressure applied to sample flask. Must be lower than ambient pressure */
    “vacuum_pressure”: Pressure
    /*
     * Temperature of the condenser chamber, where the evaporated material
     * is collected and returned to liquid phase
     */
    “condenser_temperature”: Temperature
  }
  /* Parameters for the `blowdown` mode */
  “mode_params”: {
    /* The inert gas blown on the sample surface to facilitate evaporation */
    "gas": Enum(“nitrogen”, “argon”, “helium”)
    /* Rate at which gas is blown on the sample surface */
    “blow_rate”: Flowrate,
    /* Speed at which container is vortexed during evaporation */
    “vortex_speed”: Frequency
  }
}
```

#### **Execution**
The `mode` and associated `mode_params` specified determine the selection
of device. Vendor specific implementation will determine the availability, and default values of these parameters.

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new instruction; there are no compatibility issues with existing instructions.

Add a new instruction to count cells in an aliquot

#### **Motivation**
When thawing and/or passaging cells, it is important to plate the cells at a defined density. This requires an accurate count of viable cells in the starting sample, based on presence or absence of some label. This new instruction adds the ability to count cells in an aliquot and will enable new cell-based applications.

#### **Proposal**
```
{
  "op": "count_cells",
  "wells": [well],
  "volume": volume,
  /* optional */
  "labels": [Enum("trypan_blue")],
  "dataref": string
}
```
#### **Execution**
To execute this instruction, one must count the number of cells in each of the specified aliquots, and score each cell for presence or absence of the specified labels (if any). This will consume the specified volume from each aliquot. The returned dataset will report the number of cells per milliliter that were positive for each label, and the number of cells per milliliter that were negative for each label. Currently “trypan_blue” is the only option for label, but future ASCs may add additional labels.

#### **Compatibility**
This ASC specifies a new instruction, so there are no issues with reverse compatibility.

#### **Motivation**
Solid phase extraction (SPE) is a sample preparation technique by which compounds dissolved or suspended in a liquid mixture (mobile phase) are isolated and purified according to their physical and chemical properties. SPE involves passing a liquid matrix through an adsorbent solid (stationary phase), wherein compounds of interest are separated from present interferents by their differential affinities for the stationary phase. This process is routinely used to extract analytes from a wide variety of liquid matrices.

The process typically begins with cartridge `condition`ing to wet and settle the sorbent bed and to remove fine residue. The cartridge is then `equilibrate`d with a matrix-like solvent (this step can be skipped if the conditioning solvent is matrix-like). The matrix containing compound(s) of interest is then loaded on to the column, `rinse`d with solvents to elute interferents, and finally the target compound(s) can be `elute`d.

#### **Proposal**
We propose the addition of an `spe` instruction to Autoprotocol to represent the separation of a liquid sample into multiple eluted fractions via solid phase extraction.

#### **Execution**
The sample is loaded on a single cartridge, and analyte(s) are eluted into one or more fractions. If optional parameters are not provided, defaults should be selected by the vendor depending on the specified cartridge and available instrument.

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new instruction; there are no compatibility issues with existing instructions.

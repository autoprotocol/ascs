Add `spectrophotometry` instruction

#### **Motivation**
`spectrophotometry` refers to an instruction with one or a series of plate reading steps executed on a single plate with the same device. This could be executed once, or at a defined interval, across some total duration.

In biology, this instruction is generally useful for all kinds of experiments such as for optical density reads, or ELISA reads.
When executed at a fixed interval, this can be used to capture growth curves, enzyme kinetics, or any other sort of general reaction kinetics measurement.

#### **Proposal**
We propose adding an optional `spectrophotometry` instruction.

The `groups` list consists of a list of various tasks, each specified by their `mode` and parameterized by their `mode_params`. Fields used in `mode_params` are borrowed from existing ASCs whenever reasonable. Please refer to the previous `absorbance`, `fluorescence`, `luminescence` and `incubate` ASCs for a more detailed breakdown of the various terms.

If a `target_temperature` parameter is specified, the reader will be brought up to that environment prior to all tasks. If a `shake_before` parameter is specified, shaking will be done after reaching the `target_temperature` (if relevant) and prior to the start of the first `group` task.

After both temperature and shaking is complete, each task in the `groups` will be executed in order. The first task will be executed at time 0, and this will be repeated at every specified `interval` until the `total_time` is reached.

If `total_time` is not reached at the end of executing all the tasks in the `groups`, there will be an implicit wait step until the beginning of the next interval.

#### **Execution**
For each item in the `groups` list, the "mode_params" key should only accept values that are relevant for the selected "mode".

The intention of this method is to support the execution of a spectrophotometry instruction on a single plate with the same device. If the device is unable to support all of the "groups", then it’s unable to execute this instruction.

The number of group executions shall be equivalent to the total number of intervals ("num_intervals"), and this will be executed every "interval", starting at 0s. I.e. if "num_intervals" is 3 and "interval" is 10s, reads will be at the 0s, 10s and 20s mark.


To handle the issue of intending to shake for the remainder of the duration until the next read interval but not knowing how long a read takes, one would specify a `shake` mode with no specified duration.
This will be interpreted as shaking for the remainder of the available duration during the current interval.

For example, imagine an instruction with an interval of 10s, with a `groups` list with two items: "mode: absorbance", followed by "mode: shake" with no specified duration.
Suppose the first absorbance read takes 2s. Since no duration was set for shake, the shaking operation will now be executed for the remaining 8s.
Support of `shake` with no duration at different indices of the `groups` list may be limited due to vendor support.

Support of multiple types of reading in `groups` may be limited due to vendor support.

#### **Compatibility**
This change is fully backwards compatible as it involves adding in a new instruction. Vendors should indicate if they are unable to respect any of the  parameters.

#### **Appendix: Shake Path**
The shake path shall follow existing ASC-028 conventions, i.e.

| Parameter | Type | Capability |
|--|--|--|
| path | string | "cw_orbital" (clockwise orbital), "ccw_orbital"(counterclockwise orbital), "portrait_linear" (portrait linear), "landscape_linear" (landscape linear), "cw_diamond" (clockwise diamond), "ccw_diamond" (counterclockwise diamond) |

There will be four new shake path types added as part of this ASC

| Path | Description |
|--|--|
| portrait_down_double_orbital | We are viewing the plate by looking at the top of the plate from above, in the portrait orientation (with the A1 well in the top right corner). The plate will move along a path shaped like an infinity sign, moving down-and-to-the-right, then down-and-to-the-left from the center of the infinity-shaped-path |
| landscape_down_double_orbital | We are viewing the plate by looking at the top of the plate from above, in the landscape orientation (with the A1 well in the top left corner). The plate will move along a path shaped like an infinity sign, moving down-and-to-the-right, then down-and-to-the-left from the center of the infinity-shaped-path |
| portrait_up_double_orbital | We are viewing the plate by looking at the top of the plate from above, in the portrait orientation (with the A1 well in the top right corner). The plate will move along a path shaped like an infinity sign, moving up-and-to-the-right, then up-and-to-the-left from the center of the infinity-shaped-path |
| landscape_up_double_orbital | We are viewing the plate by looking at the top of the plate from above, in the landscape orientation (with the A1 well in the top left corner). The plate will move along a path shaped like an infinity sign, moving up-and-to-the-right, then up-and-to-the-left from the center of the infinity-shaped-path |

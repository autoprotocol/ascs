#### **Title**
Add `Compound` to derived types

#### **Motivation**
The usage of chemical compounds (or substances) is common throughout science. We should have some first-class representation of this type in Autoprotocol.

#### **Proposal**
Let us add a new derived type, `Compound`, which shall be represented as a `String`. Valid formats shall include the popular `SMILES` (Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System) notation and the IUPAC `InChI` (International Chemical Identifier) notation.

To differentiate between the various formats, a `notation:value` format shall be adopted, with `:` as the delimiter.

Here are example valid values for Benzene:
| Notation      | Example Value
| -             |
| **SMILES**    | "SMILES:c1ccccc1"
| **InChI**     | "InChI:1S/C6H6/c1-2-4-6-5-3-1/h1-6H"
| **InChI Key** | "InChIKey:UHOVQNZJYSORNB-UHFFFAOYSA-N"

#### **Compatibility**
Since this is an addition, not a modification, there's no anticipated backwards compatibility issues.

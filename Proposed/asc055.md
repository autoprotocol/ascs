Add `compounds` to aliquot property

#### **Motivation**
Well or aliquot often holds single of multiple compounds inside, but the data is not captured as an aliquot property
in Python. Some of the compounds data we are proposing to include here are compound id, SMILES (Simplified Molecular-
Input Line-Entry System) string that captures 2D structure information of the compound, and the molecular weight of
the compound. These parameters will be helpful to carry out conversion between mole and different measurement units
to submit instructions. There are many other compound parameters that might be useful in the future such as compound
phase, melting temperature, pKa, etc, but those parameters will not be included in this proposal for the time being as
most of those parameter are yet to be captured in the web, and will require more work.

#### **Proposal**
We propose to add `compounds` as one of the Well attributes with some compound data.

```
{
  "aliquots": {
    "well_index": {
      /* Data for a list of compounds present in each aliquot. */
      "compounds": [
        {
          /* compound id */
          "id": String
          /* SMILES string notation of the compound. Optional. */
          "smiles": String
          /* Weight of the compound per mole expressed in gram/mole unit. Optional. */
          "molecularWeight": Unit
        }
      ],
      ...
    },
    ...
  }
}

```
#### **Execution**
Any `compounds` data attached to the specified aliquot will be transferred over as an aliquot
property in Python.

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new feature, and it is backwards compatible.

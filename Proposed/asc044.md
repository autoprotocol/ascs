#### **Motivation**
Mixing samples via agitation is a common experimental process. The agitation can be indirect, by vortexing, inverting, and rolling sample containers, or direct, through the use of a stir bar. An instruction dedicated to agitating samples in these modes is currently lacking in Autoprotocol.

#### **Proposal**
We propose a new instruction to agitate samples in containers of various sizes and shape-formats. This is acheived by specifying agitation modes, and corresponding mode-specific parameters where necessary. The `vortex` mode refers to agitation by oscillating samples in a circular motion at a specified frequency. `invert` involves the mixing of samples by slowly inverting containers up-side-down at a specified speed. `roll` refers to mixing by rolling a container sideways on a roller at a specified speed; it is often applicable for larger volume containers. `stir_bar` applies a magnetic field to spin a magnetic stir bar and is introduced directly into the sample.

```
{
  “op”: “agitate”,
  /* 
   * Sample container. Some restrictions apply to container shapes and 
   * sizes--for example, `invert` and `roll` typically cannot be applied
   * to wellplates. The implementer is responsible for enforcing size,
   * shape, and speed limitations based on devices available to the
   * execution environment.
   */
  “object”: Container,
  “duration”: Time,
  “speed”: Frequency,
  “mode”: Enum(“vortex”, “invert”, “roll”, “stir_bar”),
  /* Mode-specific parameters for the ‘stir_bar’ mode */
  “mode_params”: {
    “wells”: WellGroup
    “bar_shape”: String
    “bar_length”: Unit or String
  }
  /* Temperature at which sample is being agitated. Optional */
  “temperature”: Temperature,
}
```

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new instruction; there are no compatibility issues.

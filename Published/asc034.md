Add `mode`, `temperature` and `duration` fields to `seal` instruction

#### **Motivation**
There are different mechanisms for sealing plates including thermal and adhesive.
For thermal sealing, temperature and duration are critical parameters for ensuring a reproducible plate seal.

#### **Proposal**
We propose adding an optional `mode` field to the `seal` instruction, where `mode` describes the different ways of sealing a plate. 

For the "thermal" sealing mode, we propose adding the optional `temperature` and `duration` fields to the `mode_params` field.

```
{
  "op": "seal",
  "object": container,
  "type": "foil",
  /** optional */
  "mode": Enum("thermal", "adhesive"),
  /** The mode params below are specific to the `thermal` mode */
  "mode_params": {
    "temperature": temperature,
    "duration": time
  }
}
```

#### **Execution**
The sealing "mode" key can accept different values depending on the type of sealing methods which the vendor supports.

The "mode_params" key should only accept values which are relevant for the selected "mode".

#### **Compatibility**
This change is fully backwards compatible. Vendors should indicate if they are unable to respect these parameters.

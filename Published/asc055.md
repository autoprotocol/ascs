#### **Title**
Add `Compound` to derived types

#### **Motivation**
The usage of chemical compounds (or substances) is common throughout science. We should have some first-class representation of this type in Autoprotocol.

#### **Proposal**
Let us add a new derived type, `Compound`, which shall be represented as a `String`. We shall standardize on the IUPAC `InChI` (International Chemical Identifier) notation as the representation of choice.
Note that we will be standardizing on the `standard InChI` convention and not the `InChiKey` convention.

The reasons for choosing this format are its unambiguous nature, readability and the wide availibility of tools to interconvert to other popular formats such as SMILES.

Here are example valid values for different compounds

| Compound      | Example Value
| -             | -
| Methane       | "InChI=1S/CH4/h1H4"
| Ethanol       | "InChI=1S/C2H6O/c1-2-3/h3H,2H2,1H3"
| Benzene       | "InChI=1S/C6H6/c1-2-4-6-5-3-1/h1-6H"

#### **Compatibility**
Since this is an addition, not a modification, there's no anticipated backwards compatibility issues.

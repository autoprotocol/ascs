#### **Title**
Add `informatics` to Autoprotocol instruction schema

#### **Motivation**
In the current form, Autoprotocol is unable to capture scientific intent at the molecular level upon execution of `instruction`. One of the examples is PCR whereby a mixture of nucleotides and polymerase are mixed in a vial to synthesize new molecules via `thermocycle`. In another case, a user may want to purify a compound of interest from a mixture of compounds in instructions such as `spe` and/or `lcms`. In addition to the physical execution parameters, there should be a set of parameters describing the intended effects of an instruction on the sample composition.

#### **Proposal**
Instruction currently has `op`, and `data` attributes. We propose adding a new optional attribute, `informatics,` to the `Instruction` to represent the intended effects of an instruction. This may enable future integration of the data specified in `informatics` with vendor LIMS. This `informatics` is an optional parameter that can accept a list of effects for each instruction. `type` specifies the type of the effect, and `data` is a set of parameters to describe the effect.   

We are proposing to only add 'attach_compounds' at this time, but more types may be available in the future such as 'purify_compounds', 'liquefy', etc. Here, `wells` is a list of aliquots that are affected by the instruction. The instruction must directly operate on `wells` or its container to have any effects. `compounds` is a list of compounds that will be attached to the `wells` (for 'attach_compounds').

```
"instructions": [
  {
    "op": String
    ...,
    /*
     * optional parameter describing a list of intended effects or changes 
     * for this instruction.
     */
    "informatics": [
      {
        /* type of the effect. */
        "type": Enum("attach_compounds"),
        /* Details of the type. */
        "data": {
          "wells": List(Well) or WellGroup,
          "compounds": List(Compound)
        }
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new optional attribute to be added to the existing schema. The `informatics` field should default to None.

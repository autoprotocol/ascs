#### **Motivation**
Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry  is a commonly used technique in analytical chemistry, whereby the physical separation function of chromatography and the sample identification capability of mass spectrometry are combined to separate and identify analytes from a liquid sample containing a mixture of compounds. This is a coupled process, whereby a small portion of the eluate produced from chromatographic separation is directed to the mass spectrometer for identification, while the rest can optionally be collected as separated fractions.

#### **Proposal**
We propose adding an `lcms` instruction to represent the coupled liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry technique in Autoprotocol.

`liquid_chromatography` parameters control the isolation of the target analyte based on its interaction with the `stationary_phase` present in the `column`, and with the `buffers` that constitute the mobile phase. The composition of the mobile phase can be varied via the `gradient`, which represents the relative volumes of buffers present at different time points during the experiment.

A small portion of the eluted fractions flow at a specified `ms_flow_rate` to the mass spectrometer, where they are evaporated and ionized before mass analysis. Parameters under `ionization` and `analysis` allow for fine-grained control over their respective processes. For example, `ion_mode` controls whether the evaporated eluate is protonated (positive) or deprotonated (negative), and `detection_mode` allows the user to detect signals either in a `mass_range`, or at a specific `mass`.

Isolated fractions can optionally be collected if a UV module is present. Eluates are collected when their absorbance values exceed the `absorbance_threshold` at the specified `detection_wavelength`, and their mass intensity exceeds a specified `mass_threshold`.

#### **Execution**
Vendors are responsible for ensuring that specified parameters translate to successful operation, given the working ranges of available instruments. For example, the LC module must be capable of providing sufficient pressure to drive the sample through the column’s packed bed at the specified flowrate, given the operating temperature and the diameter of the column being used. Additionally, the `ion_source` and `mass_analyzer` will determine the type of mass spectrometer required by the instruction.

The `gradient` should generally be set such that analyte is eluted off the column close to the midpoint of the run.

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new instruction; this addition does not pose compaibility issues for existing instructions.

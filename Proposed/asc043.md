#### **Motivation**
Sonication is the process of using high intensity ultrasonic vibrations to agitate particles in solution via cavitation. The method is used in a wide variety of processes, such as mixing, cell homogenization, fragmentation of DNA and RNA molecules, and deep cleaning.

#### **Proposal**
We propose adding a `sonicate` instruction with two available modes of operation: `horn` and `bath`. The former involves the use of a metal probe, called an ultrasonic horn, to create an intense, localized shear force directly in the sample media; it is frequently used in sample homogenization and oligomer fragmentation. The `bath` mode involves ultrasound applied to samples held inside a bath; its effect is more distributed and of lower intensity than that transmitted by an ultrasonic horn. `bath`s are often applied to deep clean samples.

#### **Compatibility**
This is a new instruction; there are no compatibility issues.

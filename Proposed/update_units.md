#### **Title**
Update `Units` Definitions with units in use at Strateos

#### **Authorship**

#### **Motivation**
There are a number of units we have since adopted at Strateos for chemistry and biology purposes which are currently not present in the Autoprotocol specification.

#### **Proposal**
Add the following units
- Acceleration: `millimeter/second^2`
- ElectricPotential: `nanovolt`, `microvolt`
- Frequency: `kilohertz`, `rpm`
- Length: `nanometer`
- Matter: `nanomole`
- Power: `microwatt`, `milliwatt`
- Pressure: `bar`, `torr`
- Velocity: `millimeter/second`
- Volume: `nanoliter`
- VolumeAcceleration: `milliliter/second^2`
- VolumeFlow: `milliliter/second`

#### **Compatibility**
No backwards compatibility issues as this is just adding new units.
